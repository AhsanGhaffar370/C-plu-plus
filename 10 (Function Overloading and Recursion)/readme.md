# Function Overloading and Recursion
### **Objective(s) : Upon completion of these tasks, we will be able to learn how to.**


1.	**Function overloading**
    Functions overloading is a feature of C++ that allows us to create multiple functions with the same name, so long as they        have different Signature. Signature of fuctions include the following:
    •	Number of Prameters
    •	Order of Prameters
    •	Datatype of Prameters

2.  **Recursive Function**
   Recursive definition: defining a problem in terms of a smaller version of itself
    •	Every recursive definition must have one (or more) base cases
    •	The general case must eventually reduce to a base case
    •	The base case stops the recursion 
    Recursive method: a method that calls itself
