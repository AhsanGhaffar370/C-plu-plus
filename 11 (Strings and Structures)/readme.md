# Strings and Structures
### **Objective(s) : Upon completion of these tasks, we will be able to learn.**

1.	**Strings**
    The string is any sequence of characters. C++ strings allow you to directly initialize, assign, compare, and reassign with the intuitive operators, as well as printing and reading (e.g., from the user). to use strings, you need to include the header <string>.

2.	**several String functions**
    *   substr()
    *   replace()
    *   erase()
    *   Strcmp()
    *   Strcat()
    *   Strlen()

3.	**Structure**
    C++ arrays allow you to create different user defined data type, these data types are know as non-primitive data types or derived data type. i.e array, structures, enumeration and poitners. Array allow us to store similar data type elements in single variable. What if we need to combine differnty kind of data item in single variable. For this we have structures in C++. structure is another user defined data type which allows you to combine data items of different kinds.
    Structures are used to represent a record, Suppose you want to keep track of mechanical parts in your inventory. You might want to track the following attributes about each part:
    •	Modelumber
    •	Partnumber
    •	Cost
