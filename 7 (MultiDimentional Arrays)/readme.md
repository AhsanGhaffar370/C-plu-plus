# Multi Dimentional Arrays

Many applications require data be stored in more then one dimension. A two-dimensional array consists of both rows and columns of elements. It is essentially a matrix.

To declare a two-dimensional array, we merely use two sets of square brackets.
*	The first contains the number of rows
*	The second contains the number of columns

A two dimension array can have N Column and N Row.
